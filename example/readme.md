## **How to run**
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- Serve `index.html` file with web server.

If you don't know how to serve the `index.html`, I recommend using for example https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server :
- `npm install --global http-server`
- Run `http-server` on the `example` directory
- Load [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) with the browser and resize away!
